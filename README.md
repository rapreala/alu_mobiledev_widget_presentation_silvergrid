# SliverGrid Demo - Afrobeats Album Grid

A Spotify-inspired album grid showcasing popular Afrobeats albums and demonstrating the **SliverGrid** widget in Flutter.

## Widget Description
SliverGrid creates a scrollable 2D grid of widgets within a CustomScrollView, perfect for displaying collections like music albums, photos, or products.

## How to Run
```bash
# Clone or download this repository
git clone <your-repo-url>

# Navigate to project directory
cd sliver_grid_demo

# Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run on Android emulator or device
flutter run
```

## Three Key Properties Demonstrated

### 1. `gridDelegate` (SliverGridDelegateWithFixedCrossAxisCount)
**What it does:** Controls the layout structure of the grid - defines how albums are arranged.

**In this demo:**
- `crossAxisCount: 2` ‚Üí Creates 2 columns (typical for album grids)
- `mainAxisSpacing: 20.0` ‚Üí 20px vertical spacing between albums
- `crossAxisSpacing: 16.0` ‚Üí 16px horizontal spacing between albums
- `childAspectRatio: 0.75` ‚Üí Makes cards slightly taller than wide (album cover + text)

**Try changing:**
- Change `crossAxisCount: 2` to `crossAxisCount: 3` for a more compact view
- Adjust `childAspectRatio` to change card proportions (1.0 = square, 0.5 = tall)

### 2. `delegate` (SliverChildBuilderDelegate)
**What it does:** Provides the children (album cards) for the grid using a builder function.

**In this demo:**
- Uses `SliverChildBuilderDelegate` which builds album cards on-demand (lazy loading)
- Only creates widgets for albums currently visible on screen
- More memory efficient than creating all 16 album cards at once

**Why it matters:** 
- For large music libraries (1000+ albums), this approach only builds what's visible
- Saves memory and improves scroll performance
- Essential for apps like Spotify with massive catalogs

### 3. `childCount`
**What it does:** Specifies the total number of items (albums) in the grid.

**In this demo:**
- Set dynamically to `_afrobeatsAlbums.length` (currently 16 albums)
- Automatically adjusts when you add or remove albums from the list

**Try changing:**
- Add more albums to the `_afrobeatsAlbums` list
- The grid automatically extends to show all albums
- Remove albums to see fewer items

## Key Code Section
The main SliverGrid implementation:
```dart
SliverGrid(
  gridDelegate: const SliverGridDelegateWithFixedCrossAxisCount(
    crossAxisCount: 2,
    mainAxisSpacing: 20.0,
    crossAxisSpacing: 16.0,
    childAspectRatio: 0.75,
  ),
  delegate: SliverChildBuilderDelegate(
    (context, index) {
      final album = _afrobeatsAlbums[index];
      return AlbumCard(
        albumName: album['album']!,
        artistName: album['artist']!,
        color: album['color'] as Color,
      );
    },
    childCount: _afrobeatsAlbums.length,
  ),
)
```
